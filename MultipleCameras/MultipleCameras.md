Have you ever needed to login with two cameras to a Zoom meeting? Has it been frustrating to have to use two devices to do this? Well... there is an easier solution to the problem.

1. Get a webcam/external camera and connect it to your device.
2. Download OBS Studio: https://obsproject.com/
3. Open OBS Studio, and start adding your camera inputs. Click on the "+" sign under the sources window, and add the devices that your computer has connected.
4. You can make these sources appear on the OBS window by clicking the eye symbol next to them on the sources window.
5. Then, after you have arranged them on the virtual camera input, click "Start Virtual Camera"
6. Go to the meeting platform you are using (e.g. Zoom), and instead of choosing your video input to be one of your webcams, use the "OBS Virtual Camera" as your input. Now, your meeting video should be showing the combined camerea inputs you had setup in OBS.

That's it!
